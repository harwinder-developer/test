<em>November 28, 2017</em>
<ul>
    <li>Fixes fatal error when donating.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.1.3</h3>
<em>November 21, 2017</em>
<ul>
    <li>Ensure that the donation form validates when no donation amount is set but a product is added to cart.</li>
    <li>Fixes notices & errors related to Charitable 1.5.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.1.2</h3>
<em>September 26, 2017</em>
<ul>
    <li>Improved how the gateway is shown. For every donation made through EDD, you will now see which EDD gateway was used.</li>
    <li>Flush cache when a benefactor is changed, edited or deleted, to prevent problems with object caching systems like Memcached.</li>
    <li>Fix the way the translation files are set up.</li>
    <li>Updated to take advantage of changes coming in Charitable 1.5 (due soon!).</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.1.1</h3>
<em>April 7, 2017</em>
<ul>
    <li>Correctly pass the donor's country to the donation record when a new donation is created from an Easy Digital Downloads payment.</li>    
</ul>
<h3>1.1.0</h3>
<em>March 15, 2017</em>
<ul>
    <li>For every line item of a donation that was created from an Easy Digital Downloads payment, show where the donation came from if it was from a download purchase. Straight donations are shown regularly.</li>
    <li>Show the ID and total value of the linked payment for a donation.</li>
    <li>Added the quantity and variation of downloads purchased to the Campaign Purchases export (under Downloads > Reports > Export).</li>
    <li>When a donation was created from an Easy Digital Downloads order with multiple variations of the same download, only one of the variations was reflected in the donation. In other words, donations were created that were for too small an amount. That issue is now fixed.</li>
    <li>We added a re-sync tool that allows you to update a donation based on the linked payment. If you were affected by the issue above, you can use this tool to fix up any incorrect donations. This tool is disabled by default, since most people will not need it. To enable it, go to Charitable > Settings > Extensions.</li>
    <li>We also added a bulk action re-sync tool. It does what the regular re-sync tool does, but for multiple donations at once. Find it via Charitable > Donations.</li>
    <li>Moved all EDD Connect settings to the Extensions tab (previously they were on the General tab).</li>    
</ul>

</ul>
<h3>1.0.6</h3>
<em>February 1, 2017</em>
