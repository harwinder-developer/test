<ul>
    <li>Send the campaign notification emails to the admin and campaign creator after the campaign has been added completely, including the meta and taxonomies.

<ul>
    <li>Fixes a bug in campaign saving form that prevents campaigns being updated when no core fields are kept in the form</li>

    <li>Fixes up an issue that caused campaign end dates to be lost when a campaign is edited via the front-end campaign form.</li>

<h3>1.1.7</h3>
<em>September 6, 2016</em>
<ul>
    <li>The latest version of Charitable changed the way campaign end dates are sanitized before being saved, but this inadvertently broke campaigns submitted via Charitable Ambassadors. We have tidied up that bug.</li>
    <li>We also resolved an edge case scenario where campaigns submitted via a campaign form missing a length or end date field would not show up in the `[campaigns]` output until they were saved/updated via the WordPress dashboard.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.1.6</h3>
<em>August 16, 2016</em>
<ul>
    <li>Follow-up fix for 1.1.5. Yesterday's release contained out-dated minified Javascript. This fix has updated the minified Javascript files.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.1.5</h3>
<em>August 15, 2016</em>
<ul>
    <li>Fixes a Javascript error that prevented suggested donations from being added related to changes in Charitable 1.4.</li>
    <li>Improves how tags/categories are saved, so that it's possible to convert them to select fields without problems.</li>
    <li>Improves how the user fields are saved when a campaign is submitted; if you have customized the form to completely remove all user fields, the campaign creator will still be set correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.1.4</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Tags were never showing up as a field in the campaign submission form -- even when you have tags. Bug squashed.</li>

<em>May 25, 2016</em>
<ul>    
    <li>Added minified stylesheet.</li>
    <li>Fixes a bug that prevented the funds recipient details from being recorded when only one of the recipient types (Your Organization or Personal Causes) is enabled.</li>
    <li>Prevent the campaign form from proceeding to the next stage if no recipient type has been selected.</li>
    <li>Changed "Length" label to "Length in days" to make it clearer how the length is measured.</li>
    <li>Use the correct currency symbol in the campaign form. <strong>NOTE:</strong> This relies on changes in Charitable 1.3.7. If you are using 1.3.6 or earlier, you will not see any difference.</li>
    <li>Improved inline documentation in template files to clarify how you can override templates.</li>
    <li>Switch to using <code>transition_post_status</code> hook to send new campaign and campaign creator submission emails.</li>

<em>April 4, 2016</em>

Send your campaign creators a notification when they receive a donation, an email after they submit their campaign and an email a few days before their campaign ends (you can choose how many days ahead of time the email should go out). Go to <em>Charitable</em> > <em>Emails</em> to enable and configure your new email options!</li>
    <li>NEW: Auto-approve campaigns when they are submitted. No more code snippets required! Just enable the feature and you're done.</li>

    <li>Deprecated certain hooks:
        <ul>
            <li><code>charitable_ambassadors_admin_start</code> -- Use <code>Charitable_Ambassadors_Admin::get_instance()</code> instead.</li>
