= Using the Theme Customizer =

You can change Reach's theme options via the Customizer.

* To access the theme customizer, click Appearance → Customize in the WordPress admin menu. 
* Footer: Upload your own image to display in the footer. If it's a horizontally repeating pattern, set it to Tile Horizontally. You can also add a tagline to display on the right side of your footer. 
* Social Networks: Add your social media URLs. Leave blank any networks that you don't use.
* When you’re finished making changes, click Save & Publish to save the settings. Check out your site to confirm your changes.

----------

= Menu Setup =

You’ll need to create at least one new menu for the header.

* WordPress menus can be found under Appearence → Menus.
* If you don’t have a menu already, click create a new menu to create one.
* On the left hand side of the Menu page, select the pages to add to your menu and click Add to Menu. Drag the pages around and arrange them any way you’d like. Create a drop menu by dragging menu items under and to the right of another menu item.
* Now that you have the menu created, you need to assign it to the Primary Navigation location in the Theme Locations section.
* Save the menu when finished.
